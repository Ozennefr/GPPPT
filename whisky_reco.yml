  note_example: "Colour: bright straw. Nose: pears, gooseberries, apples, general 'orchard fruit' vibes and also some wee touches of hops, citrus and buttered toast. There's an overall more modern, American oak influenced profile on display here. But I find it extremely easy and quietly charming, it's just let down a bit by the 40% (isn't everything?). Mouth: yup, 40% is tough these days. Same lovely profile of easy sweetness and orchard fruits, only here I'd add some yellow plums, apricots and honey. But that low power gives a slight feeling of cardboard as well, sadly. Still, this in a tumbler at almost any time of day would be easy and enjoyable in my view. Finish: on the short side, going towards light fruit teas and golden ales. Some breads and cereals now too. Comments: it's a modern style, quite a long way from the glorious old distillate monster Glen Grants of yesteryear (stay tuned for some of them!) but it's also quiet, humble, easy and charmingly un-showy malt whisky. \nSGP: 541 - 80 points.
