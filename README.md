# GPPPT
A simple one file python script that executes AI processes defined in YML. 

GPPPT stands for "processes processes processes", also known as "la rÃ¨gle des trois P".

## The DSL

We designed a yaml based DSL to allow the definition of multistep processes and automate their execution by AI agents. 
Each process step is made of a prompt executed by a specified agent, and a validation substep executed by a second agent. The validation step is in charge of selecting the next step via a yes no answer.

### DSL Quickstart
- Define the process name and entrypoint: Start by defining the name of the process and its entrypoint. The entrypoint is the first step of the process and is the point at which the process begins.

- Define the maximum length of the process: You can specify the maximum length of the process, after which it will fail.

- Define the agents: Next, define the agents that will be involved in the process. In your case, you have four agents - manager, worker, bookeeper, and user. You can specify the roleplay, kind, and options for each agent.

- Define the variables: You can define any variables that will be used in the process. For example, you have defined a variable note_example which is used in the hallucinate step.

- Define the steps: Finally, define the steps that will be executed in the process. Each step has an agent, a prompt, and a validation substep. The validation substep is mandatory, but you can fake it with a mock agent to make sure it always pass (see the `fail` step in the example). Each step also has an on_success and an on_failure action that will be taken based on the answer given by the agent.

### Agents
Agents are defined in two specific sections. 
First, we need to define the plugin list `agents_plugins`, containing the python modules we can load to define agents. Then, the `agents` section define the agents and their options. For now, 4 agent types are defined:
- chat_agent: openai chatgpt agent (oai_agent)
- vector search: agent that embed the prompt and find the closest on in a corpus (oai_agent)
- mock agent: always answer with "response" (base_agent)
- input agent: prints the prompt and returns user input (base_agent)

## Usage

make sure to put your openai apik in the env variable "OPENAI_KEY"

````
Usage: main.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...         
Commands:
  draw                          
  parse                           
  run                             
````
### Run
Execute the process
````
$ python3 gpppt/main.py run test.yml
Parsing successful!
 what can i do for you today ?
something to go with rice
 lorem ipsum.

Here is the complete note : lorem ipsum.. 


 Type any key to start the process over.

To use the whisky example, you need a feather file conataining whisky notes and their corresponding embeddings.


### Draw
Draw the process as mermaid code

$ python3 gpppt/main.py drawe whisky_reco.yml

## Changelog
- 12/03: first working version
- 26/03: 
  - refactor agents in "plugins"
  - refactor main in subcommands
  - add parse command to check if the DSL has issues
  - add draw command the generates mermaid code representing the process and agents.

## Backlog
- Publish on pipy
- Publish agents on pypi
- Polish whisky recommender and ship it
- Smarter backtracking: keep k options at each generation and explore the tree depth first
- Develop other usecases

## ChatGPT generated yml (One shot - not parsing but close)
